# Maze Solver Using A* Search Algorithm

## Project Description
This Python project implements the **A*** search algorithm to solve maze navigation problems efficiently. The algorithm uses the Manhattan distance heuristic to quickly find the shortest path from a starting point to a goal within a maze. It provides clear visualization of the solution path, calculates the total cost, and measures execution time to demonstrate performance.

## Features
- **A* Search Algorithm:** Quickly identifies the shortest path using heuristics.
- **Heuristic Function:** Uses Manhattan distance to estimate distances optimally.
- **Visualization:** Clearly represents the solution path within the maze.
- **Performance Metrics:** Displays total path cost and execution time.

## Technologies Used
- Python
